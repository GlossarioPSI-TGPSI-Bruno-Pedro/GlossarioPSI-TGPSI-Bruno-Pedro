Internal:<div id="c">  It is an access specifier, it means this statement restricts access
which other classes have to class or variable that the internal constrains. There are several types of
access specifiers, internal restricts access to classes that derive from the class
where the internal, public specifies that a certain class or variable is of
free access to all other classes of the program, and private isolates the class or variable,
making it inaccessible.</div>
